Strokes gained per tournament in categories, total
Raw strokes gained  = (scoring - fieldscoring) in X category.
Time weighted strokes gained = (scoring - fieldscoring) x ((var/dayspast)x100%)
rounds played weighted  strokes gained = (RSGtourMEDIAN - (scoring-fieldscoring))* weightfactor/100 + (RSG) * 1-weightfactor/100
true strokes gained = RSG-fieldRSG + (FieldRSG-TourRSG)


Driving distance + accuracy 
	-adjusted for field average drive and accuracy, then adjusted by field strength
	-ie true avg dist +/- = ((avgdist - fieldavgdist) + (fieldavgdist-touravgdist))
	ie yards gained
		true driving accuracy (fairway% - fieldfairway%) + (fieldfairway%-tourfairway%)
